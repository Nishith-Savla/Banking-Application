# Banking-Application
A Java project of an example Banking Application connected with a localhost database

I have a made this sample project using Java, Java Swing framework and JDBC.

To run this, 
  1. Create a new Java Project in whatever IDE you want.
  2. Put the app and the media folder from the src folder to the source (src) folder of your project.
  3. Create a MySQL(or any other) database(e.g. java_login) and in it create a table (e.g. bank_account) with 7  columns i.e Username, AccNo, Password, Age, Gender, Email, Balance.
  4. Modify the database url, username & password in it the Deposit.java, Withdraw.java, Login, Get_balance.java and SQLinsert.java files.
  5. I've also attacted the jar files of libraries necessary for this, which you can add in the lib folder.
